# ðŸ§  DigitNet â€” Handwritten Digit Recognition from Scratch

A simple neural network built **from scratch in Python using NumPy**, trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9).

> ðŸ”¢ Achieves over **90% accuracy** on the MNIST test set  
> ðŸ§® Implements feedforward, backpropagation, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) from first principles  
> ðŸš« No machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch â€” everything is handcrafted
